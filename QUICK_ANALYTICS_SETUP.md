## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: Chart not showing

**Solution**: Make sure `recharts` is installed:

```bash
cd frontend && npm install recharts
```

### Issue: Backend won't start (port in use)

**Solution**: Kill process on port 5000:

```bash
lsof -i:5000
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Issue: No data in analytics

**Solution**: Count some zikr first:

1. Go to /zikr
2. Count at least 10-20 zikr
3. Then check analytics

### Issue: Streak not updating

**Solution**: Check backend logs for streak check errors. Ensure:

- MongoDB is connected
- ZikrGoal and ZikrStreak models are imported
- Analytics routes are registered in app.js

## 📊 Sample Data for Testing

To test with realistic data, you can manually add entries via MongoDB or count zikr over several days:

```javascript
// Day 1: 120 zikr
// Day 2: 95 zikr
// Day 3: 150 zikr
// Day 4: 80 zikr
// Day 5: 110 zikr
// Day 6: 0 zikr (miss)
// Day 7: 130 zikr
```

This will give you:

- Varied chart data
- Streak of 1 (reset after day 6)
- Different daily counts
- Best day: Day 3 (150)
- Average: ~98

   - What if streak is paused?
   - What about very large numbers?

3. **Mobile Testing**

   - Try on real device
   - Check touch interactions
   - Verify responsive layout

4. **Performance**

   - Check load times
   - Verify smooth animations
   - Test with large datasets

5. **Deploy**
   - Push to git
