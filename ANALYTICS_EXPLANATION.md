# 📊 Analytics Page Explanation

## Understanding Your Zikr Analytics

The Analytics page (`/analytics`) provides detailed insights into your Zikr practice. Here's what each metric means:

---

## 🔢 Main Metrics

### **1. Total Zikr Count (145)**

- **What it is:** The sum of ALL zikr you've ever counted across ALL types
- **Example:** If you counted:
  - SubhanAllah: 59 times
  - Allahu Akbar: 46 times
  - Alhamdulillah: 40 times
  - **Total = 59 + 46 + 40 = 145**
- **Purpose:** Shows your overall devotion and consistency

### **2. Today Count (3)**

- **What it is:** Count from the current session/today only
- **Purpose:** Track daily progress
- **Note:** This resets each day

### **3. Rounds (1)**

- **What it is:** Total count ÷ 33 (rounded up)
- **Why 33?** Traditional tasbeeh has 33 beads per section
- **Example:** If total = 145, then 145 ÷ 33 = 4.39 → **5 rounds**
- **Purpose:** Traditional measurement unit for Muslims

### **4. Types (4)**

- **What it is:** Number of different zikr phrases you're tracking
- **Example:** SubhanAllah, Alhamdulillah, Allahu Akbar, La ilaha illallah = 4 types
- **Purpose:** Shows variety in your remembrance

## 🤔 Common Questions

### **Q: Why do I have two "total" numbers?**

**A:**

- **Top "Total Zikr Count"** = All-time total (145)
- **Bottom "All Time"** = Same number, just repeated for quick reference
- They should always match!

### **Q: What's the difference between "Today" and "Total"?**

**A:**

- **Today (3):** Only counts from current session/day
- **Total (145):** All counts ever, across all time
- **Example:** If you counted 100 yesterday and 45 today, Total = 145, Today = 45

### **Q: Why are the percentages important?**

**A:** They help you:

- See which zikr you practice most
- Balance your dhikr practice
- Track if you're neglecting certain phrases
- **Ideal:** Roughly equal percentages (33% each for 3 types)

### **Q: How is "Rounds" calculated?**

**A:**

- Traditional tasbeeh has 33 beads
- **Formula:** Total Count ÷ 33 (rounded up)
- **Example:** 145 ÷ 33 = 4.39 → **5 rounds**
- **Purpose:** Measure in traditional Islamic units

### **Q: Why does "Most Count" matter?**

**A:**

- Shows your favorite/most practiced zikr
- Helps you identify patterns
- Encourages balancing your practice

### **Q: What's a good "Avg/Type"?**

**A:**

- Higher is generally better (more consistency)
- But quality > quantity in remembrance
- If one type is much lower, maybe practice it more

- Monitor if you're practicing daily
- Celebrate milestones (100, 500, 1000)
