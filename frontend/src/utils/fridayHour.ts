// The Friday "hour of response" — the last stretch of Jumuʿah before sunset.
//
// "Friday is divided into twelve hours. Amongst them there is an hour in which
//  a Muslim does not ask Allah for anything but He gives it to him. So seek it
//  in the LAST HOUR AFTER THE AFTERNOON PRAYER."
//  — Sunan Abī Dāwūd 1048, graded Ṣaḥīḥ by al-Albānī.
//
// Scholars differ on the exact minute, and the hadith itself says to *seek*
// it, so this deliberately marks the whole ʿAṣr→Maghrib window rather than
// pretending to pinpoint a moment. The final stretch before Maghrib is
// highlighted because that is where the narration directs the search.
