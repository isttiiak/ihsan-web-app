/**
 * One itemized missed-prayer record — unlike SalatDebt (a flat running
 * counter) or SalatDebtEvent (an anonymous delta log, "when did the total
 * change" but not "which specific prayer"), a KazaUnit ties a debt unit to
 * the EXACT day it was missed, so it can be resolved individually and
 * genuinely new analysis becomes possible ("how long did that Fajr sit
 * unpaid", "what's the oldest thing you still owe").
 *
 * Deliberately only created where a real, specific date is known — the
 * automatic day-rollover sweep (ensureCaughtUp) and a specific past day's
 * log edit both know exactly which day+prayer. The generic +/- debt
 * adjuster and the one-time "estimate what you owe" setup do NOT create
 * these (see salatDebt.service.ts) — assigning a fake date to an anonymous
 * bulk correction would be misleading data, not useful analysis. Those
 * portions of a user's debt simply have no itemized record, same as before
 * this model existed; SalatDebt.owed stays the authoritative total either way.
