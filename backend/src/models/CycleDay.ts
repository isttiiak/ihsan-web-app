/**
 * Optional per-day wellness note during a cycle — flow intensity, symptoms,
 * mood. Purely private (same hard rule as CycleLog: never exposed through any
 * social endpoint). One row per user per local day.
 *
 * The content itself (flow/symptoms/moods/garden) is never queried, sorted,
 * or indexed on — only read/written whole by cycle.service.ts — so it is
 * stored as a single AES-256-GCM blob (`enc`, see utils/fieldCrypto.ts)
 * rather than plaintext fields, keeping it unreadable to anyone with raw
 * DB/Atlas access. `date` stays plaintext since it drives the unique index.
