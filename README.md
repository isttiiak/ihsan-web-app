# 🌙 Ihsan — Islamic Productivity App

**Live:** [https://ihsan-web-app-main.vercel.app/](https://ihsan-web-app-main.vercel.app/)

> *Iḥsān is to worship Allah as though you see Him.*

A calm, ad-free companion for the Muslim day — salat, zikr, Quran, fasting, prayer
times, a first-of-its-kind cycle room for sisters, and a dedicated Ramadan home.
Free forever, private by design, and honest with **every** reference: each Quran
verse and hadith links to quran.com or sunnah.com with its exact number and grade.

## ✨ Features

### 📿 Zikr Counter
- Local-first tap counter with focus mode, goals, and custom dhikr — each with Arabic, transliteration and a verified reference
- A curated zikr **library** in Settings: ṣalawāt (Durud Ibrāhīm & the short ṣalawāt), every istighfār formula, the weighty words, calls on His Names — one tap to add to your own list
- Six **core adhkār** (SubḥānAllah, Alḥamdulillah, Allāhu Akbar, the tahlīl, Āyatul Kursī, Astaghfirullāh) can never be deleted — the salat wiring depends on them
- A fair streak system: miss one day and you get a grace chance 🧊; backfill up to 2 days to repair a streak (works on mobile and web)
- Analytics: trends, per-type breakdown, weekly heatmap with met/grace/missed tags — rendered with a hand-rolled SVG chart, no heavyweight charting library

### 🕌 Salat Tracker — wired to zikr & Quran
- All five fard prayers with on-time / late / missed states, location (mosque / jamaah / home), sunnah and nafl
- **Mark the tasbīḥ after a prayer and it posts to your zikr counter itself** — no more opening the counter five times a day to log 33s by hand (un-tap subtracts the same amount)
- **Salat settings** (⚙️): choose your tasbīḥ mode — 33/33/33 + tahlīl *(Muslim 597a, default)* or 33/33/34 *(Muslim 596a)* — and your ʿAṣr **madhab** (standard or Ḥanafī, which shifts ʿAṣr's start and Ẓuhr's end)
- Post-salat surahs one tap away: Āyatul Kursī + the three Quls after every fard, al-Mulk after Isha, al-Kahf on Friday — with a live ʿAṣr→Maghrib duʿā-hour banner on Fridays
- Nafl (Tahajjud, Duha, Ishraq, Awwābīn…) with a minimum of 2 rakʿah, pair-stepped
- Streaks, per-prayer analytics, and a 90-day calendar. During Ramadan a tarawih row appears under Isha

### 🕐 Prayer Times
- Calculated fully **on-device** (adhan, Moonsighting Committee) — GPS or city search, **your location never leaves your browser**
- Live clock with current/next prayer, forbidden windows and nafl windows on an educational timeline

### 🌙 Fasting Tracker
- Fiqh-aware: qaḍā make-up counter, kaffārah (consecutive-day tracking), vowed fasts, and every sunnah day (Mon/Thu, White Days, ʿArafah, ʿĀshūrā, Six of Shawwāl…)
- Blocks ḥarām days (Eids, Tashrīq) and warns on disliked ones — each rule cites its exact hadith
- Intention auto-completes after iftar; month calendar; full analytics with editable history

### 🌟 Ramadan — a self-contained room (`/ramadan`)
- **Countdown mode** before the month: days-until, expected Gregorian date, and "prepare your heart" links (qaḍā, Shaʿbān, Quran)
- **Live mode**: Day N hero with a live suhoor→iftar countdown pill, the salat tracker **inline** (five fard rows + nafl + a tarawih toggle — the same rows and hooks as `/salat`, no extra navigation), a three-*ashra* calendar (Raḥmah / Maghfirah / ʿItq min an-Nār) with pulsing odd nights, and a worship strip to every tracker
- **Ramadan analytics** (`/ramadan/analytics`): fasted vs *obligated* rate (excused days are subtracted from the denominator so they never drag it down), longest run, tarawih nights, per-ashra bars, last-ten focus
- Rayhanah-aware: excused days show 🌸 and flow into the qaḍā counter automatically

### 📖 Quran — a complete reading & listening home
- Āyah-by-āyah reader: one calm card with the Arabic and its meaning, single-āyah recitation with word highlighting, fullscreen mode with a draggable tafsir split, keyboard navigation, bookmarks, in-app zoom
- Six rooms: Overview · Khatam (serial journey) · Read (any surah, searchable) · Listen (7 reciters, Yasser Al-Dossari default) · Analytics · Saved
- Authentic tafsir (Ibn Kathīr, Maʿārif and more, EN/BN) sourced from quran.com — never AI
- Beloved surahs, authentic protection selections (Āyatul Kursī, last verses of al-Baqarah…), and duʿās from the Quran — each opens straight in the reader
- **One unified streak**: āyāt from khatam, free reading, special selections and listening all count toward your daily goal

### 🤝 Friends — "So compete with one another in doing good" *(Quran 2:148)*
- Connect via a single invite link; see each other's streaks and today's worship
- A calm daily measure called **Noor** (max 100: prayers 50 · zikr streak 20 · Quran goal 20 · fasting 10) — today's Noor resets at midnight, all-time Noor only ever grows

### 🌸 Rayhanah Cycle — for our sisters
- The **first** Muslim productivity app with first-class menstrual & post-natal (nifās) support
- Salat & fasting pause automatically with zero guilt — dhikr, Quran listening & ṣalawāt take over your Noor, and **nothing about it is ever visible to friends**
- Ghusl guide, cycle predictions, madhab-aware istiḥāḍa guidance, and Ramadan days auto-added to your qaḍā counter
- Private flow / symptom / mood notes, a cycle calendar with predicted windows, and a dedicated analytics page with a regularity score, prediction windows, and past-period backfill

### 🌍 Built right
- Hijri dates with a ±1-day moon-sighting adjustment; every quote linked to quran.com / sunnah.com with grading
- Wherever a **ḍaʿīf** (weak) grade appears, a `<DaifExplainer>` card before the footer names the claim, the collection, the *specific* defect in the chain, the verdict, and how Ihsan uses it anyway — we never ship a weak label without the reasoning
- **Fajr-to-Fajr worship day** (the day flips at dawn, not midnight); celebration animations that respect reduced-motion
- **PWA**: installable, offline-ready, and self-updating (workbox `skipWaiting` + `clientsClaim`)
- **i18n** (English + Bengali) on the core screens; **full backup** export / restore and per-feature deletion from Settings

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18 + TypeScript** · **Vite**
- **Zustand** (local state) · **TanStack React Query** + persist-client (server state, offline cache)
- **Tailwind CSS** + **DaisyUI** · **Framer Motion**
- **vite-plugin-pwa** (workbox) · **react-i18next**
- Charts are **hand-rolled SVG** (Catmull-Rom → Bézier) — no charting dependency

### Backend
- **Node.js + Express + TypeScript** (`tsx` in dev, `tsc` in prod)
- Ships as **one Vercel serverless function** (`api/index.ts`) — the whole Express app, region Singapore (`sin1`)
- **MongoDB Atlas** (Mongoose, cached connection reused across warm invocations)
- **Firebase Auth** — Bearer ID tokens, no cookies. `firebase-admin` pinned to **v12** (v14 breaks the serverless bundle)
- **Zod** validation on every write route · **Jest** (ESM + ts-jest, mongodb-memory-server)

> There is **no cron** and no separate long-running server. Anything time-decayed
> (e.g. streaks) is computed lazily on read.

## 🛠️ Local Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js **v18+** (repo targets Node 22 in prod)
- A MongoDB connection string (Atlas M0 is fine)
- A Firebase project (for authentication)

### 1. Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/isttiiak/ihsan-web-app.git
cd ihsan-web-app
```

### 2. Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
# create backend/.env with:
#   MONGODB_URI, FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID, FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY, FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
#   (optional AI: GROQ_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY)

# macOS note: port 5000 is taken by AirPlay Receiver — run on 5001
PORT=5001 npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
# create frontend/.env.local with:
#   VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5001
#   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY, VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN, VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
#   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET, VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID, VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID
#   VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID   (optional — GA4, e.g. G-XXXXXXXXXX)
#   VITE_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY (optional — feedback/contact form delivery)

npm run dev
```

### 4. Open
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend:  http://localhost:5001

> In production the frontend calls the API **same-origin** (`/api`) — no second
> host, no CORS. `VITE_BACKEND_URL` is only for local dev.

## 🕰️ How "today" works

Ihsan's tracking day flows the way a worship day does — **it flips at local Fajr,
not midnight** (`utils/trackingDay.ts`). Isha prayed at 1 AM and suhoor before
dawn belong to the right day. Salat and fasting use client-authoritative local
civil date strings; the server clock is never the source of "today". Hijri dates
go through `getHijriDate()` with a user ±1-day moon-sighting adjustment.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
cd backend && npm test   # jest ESM + ts-jest, mongodb-memory-server (54 tests)
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment (Vercel)

The whole app deploys as one Vercel project:
- **Root Directory** points at the repo root; `vercel.json` builds `frontend/dist`
  and serves `api/index.ts` as a serverless function (region `sin1`).
- Set the backend env vars (Mongo, Firebase Admin) **and** the `VITE_*` frontend
  env vars in the Vercel dashboard.
- Root `package.json` **must** keep `"type": "module"` — without it the serverless
  bundle fails with `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`.
- Keep `firebase-admin` at **v12** — v14 pulls an ESM-only `jose` that breaks
  `verifyIdToken()` in the bundled runtime.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome — fork, branch (`feature/…`), and open a PR.
For translations, add values to `frontend/src/locales/<lang>/common.json`
(keep Arabic and references **out** of translation files). Any Quran/hadith
addition must link to quran.com or sunnah.com with the exact number and grade —
if it can't be verified, it doesn't ship.
